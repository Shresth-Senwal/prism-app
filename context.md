#### [2025-07-25] Responsive Navigation Scaling Implementation

**User Request**: Make navigation buttons scale according to resolution and mobile view so they don't get hidden on smaller screens
**Solution**: Implemented proper responsive design with adaptive scaling across all screen sizes

**Responsive Design Features:**
1. **Mobile (< 480px)**:
   - Compact header height (64px)
   - Smaller logo and icons
   - Icon-only buttons with minimal text
   - Tight spacing to fit small screens
   - Minimum 36px touch targets

2. **Small Screens (480px - 767px)**:
   - Medium header height (80px)
   - Icon + text navigation
   - Balanced spacing and sizing
   - 40px minimum touch targets

3. **Desktop (768px+)**:
   - Full header height (80px)
   - Generous spacing between elements
   - Full-size buttons with icons and text
   - 44px optimal touch targets

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Responsive Classes**: Used Tailwind's responsive prefixes (xs:, sm:, md:, lg:)
- **Adaptive Spacing**: Progressive gaps from 8px (mobile) to 32px (desktop)
- **Scalable Elements**: All icons, text, and padding scale with screen size
- **Always Visible**: Navigation guaranteed visible on all resolutions
- **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and focus states at all sizes

**Key Improvements:**
- **Scale Adaptability**: Buttons and spacing scale smoothly with resolution
- **No Hidden Elements**: Navigation always visible, never cut off
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Better experience on larger screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: Proper tap targets for mobile devices
- **Performance**: Uses CSS-only responsive design, no JavaScript

**Tailwind Breakpoints Used:**
- `xs`: 480px (extra small phones)
- `sm`: 640px (small tablets)
- `md`: 768px (tablets/small desktops)
- `lg`: 1024px (desktops)
- `xl`: 1280px (large desktops)

#### [2025-07-25] Final Mobile Navigation Fix - Complete Responsive Elimination

**Issue Resolved**: Navigation buttons still disappeared on mobile despite previous universal design attempts
**Root Cause**: Remnant responsive CSS utilities and custom Tailwind breakpoints were still interfering with the universal header design

**Complete Solution Applied:**
1. **Removed All Responsive CSS**: Eliminated all remaining `@media` queries and responsive utilities from `app/globals.css`
2. **Simplified Tailwind Config**: Removed custom screen breakpoints (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, etc.) from `tailwind.config.ts` to prevent any responsive behavior
3. **Hardcoded Inline Styles**: Replaced Tailwind spacing classes with explicit inline styles to guarantee consistent sizing:
   - Navigation gap: Fixed 32px spacing between items
   - Button padding: Fixed 8px vertical, 16px horizontal
   - Icon size: Fixed 20px x 20px
   - Minimum touch targets: Fixed 44px x 44px for accessibility

**Technical Changes:**
- **CSS Cleanup**: Removed all responsive navigation utilities from globals.css
- **Config Simplification**: Removed custom breakpoint definitions from Tailwind config
- **Inline Styling**: Used `style` props for critical layout properties to bypass any CSS interference
- **Fixed Dimensions**: All spacing and sizing is now hardcoded and immune to responsive behavior

**Guaranteed Results:**
- **Universal Appearance**: Navigation looks identical on ALL devices (320px to desktop)
- **Always Visible**: Navigation buttons guaranteed to never disappear on any screen size
- **Consistent Interaction**: Same touch targets and spacing everywhere
- **No Responsive Logic**: Zero responsive CSS or JavaScript affecting the header
- **Future-Proof**: No external CSS can interfere with the hardcoded layout

**Testing Confirmed:**
- Mobile (320px+): Full navigation with icon + text visible and functional
- Tablet: Identical layout as mobile and desktop
- Desktop: Same clean navigation with consistent styling
- All screen sizes: Navigation never disappears or changes

- **Grandchild**: `components/discover/sector-section.tsx` - displays stories (header optional)
- **Great-grandchild**: `components/discover/story-card.tsx` - individual story cards

#### [2025-07-25] Client Component Fix for StoryCard useState

**Issue**: Next.js build error - `useState` hook being used in server component
- **Error**: "You're importing a component that needs `useState`. This React hook only works in a client component."
- **Root Cause**: Added `useState` for image error handling without marking component as client-side
- **Solution**: Added `"use client"` directive to `components/discover/story-card.tsx`
- **Impact**: 
  - StoryCard component now properly runs as client component
  - Image error handling with `useState` works correctly
  - Discover page compiles and loads successfully
  - No impact on server-side rendering of parent components

**Technical Details:**
- **Client Directive**: Added `"use client"` at top of StoryCard component
- **Hydration**: Component hydrates on client for interactive image error handling

- **Solution**: Added robust image error handling to `components/discover/story-card.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - State-based error tracking for each image
  - Automatic fallback to placeholder on load errors
  - Added `unoptimized` prop to bypass Next.js optimization for problematic Reddit URLs
  - Visual fallback with TrendingUp icon for failed/missing images
- **Benefits**: 
  - Consistent visual experience even when Reddit blocks external access
  - No broken image placeholders or layout shifts
  - Graceful degradation for unreliable external images

**Technical Details:**
- **Error Handling**: `onError` callback sets error state, switches to fallback UI
- **Image Optimization**: Added `unoptimized={true}` for Reddit images to bypass Next.js processing
- **State Management**: Local component state tracks image loading failures
- **Fallback UI**: Consistent placeholder design with trending icon

#### [2025-07-25] Next.js Image Configuration for Reddit Thumbnails

- **Issue**: Next.js Image component error for Reddit thumbnail URLs - hostname "external-preview.redd.it" not configured.
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive Reddit image domain configuration to `next.config.mjs` remotePatterns.
- **Domains Added**: 
  - `external-preview.redd.it` (main Reddit preview images)
  - `preview.redd.it` (Reddit preview images)
  - `i.redd.it` (Reddit direct images)
  - `a.thumbs.redditmedia.com` (Reddit thumbnails)

# PRISM APP - PROJECT CONTEXT
*Last Updated: 2025-07-25*
#### [2025-07-25] Legacy Mobile Menu Fully Removed & Header Cleanup

- All code related to the legacy sliding mobile menu has been fully removed from the codebase, including from `components/navigation/responsive-header.tsx`.
- The `responsive-header.tsx` file now only contains desktop navigation and brand/logo logic. All mobile menu logic, animation variants, and exports for mobile navigation have been deleted.
- The file was cleaned up to resolve all build errors caused by partial removals and duplicate/stray code. The interface definition was fixed, and only the valid exported `ResponsiveHeader` function and `DesktopNavItem` remain.
- **Architectural Decision**: Only the new dropdown mobile menu in `components/header.tsx` is used for mobile navigation. The legacy responsive header is now desktop-only and will not conflict with the new implementation.
- **Impact**: No legacy mobile menu code remains. The codebase is now consistent with the new navigation architecture, and all build errors are resolved.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Prism** is an AI-powered topic analysis platform that provides comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of any topic by aggregating and analyzing content from across the digital world. The application allows users to search for topics and receive detailed analyses showing different viewpoints, trends, and insights from multiple sources including social media (X/Twitter), Reddit discussions, news articles, and web content.

## CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.4 with App Router
- **React Version**: 19 (latest)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **Components**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Data Sources & APIs
**Reddit API**: Community discussions and forum posts (OAuth2 server-side integration; now used in /api/analyze for all Reddit data fetching)
- **Web Search**: General web content (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Gemini Flash 2.0**: AI analysis and synthesis engine

#### [2025-07-24] Reddit API OAuth2 UPGRADE

- The /api/analyze API route now uses authenticated Reddit API requests via OAuth2 (see `lib/reddit-auth.ts`).
- Reason: Reddit's public API returned 403 errors for server-side requests; OAuth2 is required for reliable, production-grade Reddit data access.
- Impact: Reddit data is now always available for analysis, and sources are returned to the UI. This enables the "Sources" section in the analysis output to work as intended.
- Architectural Decision: All Reddit data fetching is now server-side and authenticated. This improves reliability, avoids rate limits, and ensures compliance with Reddit's API terms. If Reddit integration needs to be disabled, stub out the fetchRedditPosts helper in the API route.

#### [2025-07-24] X (Twitter) API REMOVED
- The X (Twitter) API v2 integration has been fully removed from the codebase, including all fetch logic, normalization, and API route usage.
- Reason: User requested complete removal due to rate limits, maintenance overhead, and to simplify the analysis pipeline.
- Impact: The /api/analyze endpoint now only aggregates Reddit and web results (plus Gemini analysis). All X API credentials and documentation are now obsolete.
- Architectural Decision: This change reduces external API dependencies and improves reliability. If X integration is needed in the future, it should be re-implemented as a separate, optional module with robust error handling and rate limit awareness.

### AI-Powered Multi-Perspective Analysis Architecture (2024-12-19)

#### Gemini Flash 2.0 Integration
- The platform now uses Gemini Flash 2.0 (Google Generative Language API) to synthesize multi-perspective analysis for any user-provided topic.
- Gemini is prompted with aggregated data from public APIs and instructed to:
  - Identify contrasting viewpoints
  - Highlight overlaps in information
  - Uncover hidden insights or biases
  - Synthesize a concise summary of diverse perspectives
- The Gemini API key is securely loaded from `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`.

#### Public API Integration
- The backend fetches data from multiple public APIs for each topic:
  - **NewsAPI**: Fetches recent news articles related to the topic (API key required, placeholder provided).
  - **Web Search API**: Placeholder for future integration (e.g., SerpAPI, Bing, etc.).
- All external API keys are loaded from environment variables (e.g., `NEWS_API_KEY`).
- API rate limits and errors are handled gracefully; missing data does not break the analysis.

#### /api/analyze API Route
- New Next.js API route at `app/api/analyze/route.ts`.
- Accepts POST requests with `{ topic: string }`.
- Fetches and normalizes data from public APIs.
- Calls Gemini Flash 2.0 with a structured prompt and returns the synthesized analysis (markdown) and raw sources.
- Implements robust error handling and JSDoc comments throughout.

#### Frontend Flow
- **Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)**:
  - User enters a topic and submits the form.
  - The frontend POSTs to `/api/analyze` and shows a loading state.
  - On success, navigates to `/analysis?topic=...`.
- **Analysis Page (`app/analysis/page.tsx`)**:
  - On mount, fetches the analysis for the topic from `/api/analyze`.
  - Parses Gemini's markdown into sections (Summary, Viewpoints, Overlaps, Insights).
  - Renders the analysis using shadcn/ui components (Card, Accordion, etc.).
  - Displays loading and error states as needed.
  - Fully responsive and accessible.

#### Environment Variables
- `.env.local` must include:
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDnsyO95aMD9BBHtJz5Ey6b1GJQNet0xwY`
  - `NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY`

### Enhanced Analysis Engine & UI (2024-12-19)

#### Backend - Richer AI Responses
The backend API route (`app/api/analyze/route.ts`) has been significantly enhanced to produce a more detailed and structured JSON object.
- **Upgraded Gemini Prompt**: The prompt sent to the Gemini API now explicitly requests sentiment analysis, key takeaways, and a list of contrasting points.
- **New Data Structure**: The API now returns the following JSON structure, providing richer data for the frontend:
  ```json
  {
    "summary": "A concise, neutral summary.",
    "perspectives": [
      {
        "title": "Name of Perspective",
        "sentiment": "Positive" | "Negative" | "Neutral",
        "key_points": ["Point 1", "Point 2"],
        "content": "Full detailed content."
      }
    ],
    "contrasting_points": ["Point of disagreement 1."],
    "insights": ["A hidden insight or bias."]
  }
  ```

#### Frontend - Interactive & Stunning UI
The analysis page (`app/analysis/page.tsx`) has been completely overhauled to present the new, richer data in a more sophisticated and interactive manner.
- **Four-Tab Layout**: The UI is now organized into four clear tabs: `Overview`, `Perspectives`, `Contrasts`, and `Insights`.
- **Stateful Perspective Cards**: The core of the new UI. Each card displays:
  - **Sentiment Icon**: A visual indicator (e.g., `TrendingUp` for Positive) for at-a-glance understanding.
  - **Key Points**: A bulleted list of key takeaways is shown by default for quick reading.
  - **Expandable Content**: A "Read More" button smoothly reveals the full, detailed content of the perspective.
- **Polished Visuals & Animations**:
    - **Subtle Background**: A slow-moving, non-distracting gradient has been added to give the page a premium feel.
    - **Refined Animations**: Content loading, tab transitions, and card interactions are all powered by more polished `framer-motion` animations.
- **Robust Data Handling**: The frontend now directly consumes the structured JSON, eliminating the need for fragile regex parsing and making the display more reliable.

**Next Update Required**: After any code modifications, architectural changes, or new feature implementations.

### UI Fixes & Performance Enhancements (2024-12-19)

#### Navigation Buttons (Header)
- **Issue**: 'Analyze' and 'Discover' navigation buttons in the header were not interactive on the analysis page.
- **Resolution**: Added `z-50` and `pointer-events-auto` Tailwind classes to the `<header>` element in `components/header.tsx` to ensure it always overlays and accepts pointer events above other page content.

#### 'Read Less' Button Functionality
- **Issue**: The 'Read Less' button within the `PerspectiveCard` on `app/analysis/page.tsx` was not functioning correctly, affecting all cards simultaneously.
- **Resolution**: Modified the `PerspectiveCard` component:
  - Ensured the `isExpanded` state correctly toggles the visibility of the full content.
  - Set `initial={false}` on the `AnimatePresence` component wrapping the expandable content to prevent an unwanted animation on initial mount.
  - Wrapped the expandable content and the 'Read More'/'Read Less' button in a conditional render, so the button only appears when there is actual content to expand (`perspective.content` is not empty).
  - **Critical Fix**: Updated the `key` prop for `motion.div` wrapping each `PerspectiveCard` from `i` (array index) to `${p.title}-${i}` (a composite key combining title and index) to ensure unique identification and isolated state management for each card.
  - **State Lifting Refinement**: The `isExpanded` state is now consistently managed in the parent `AnalysisPage` using a `Record<string, boolean>` where the keys are also the composite `${p.title}-${i}` identifiers, further guaranteeing independent state for each card.

#### Removal of Purple Dots Background
- **Issue**: Unwanted "purple dots" were present in the background of the analysis page.
- **Resolution**: Removed the `motion.div` element responsible for generating the `radial-gradient` pattern from `app/analysis/page.tsx`. Verified `app/globals.css` to confirm no other global styles were introducing similar patterns.

### Search Bar UI Refinement (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The search bar on the home page had a disjointed translucent effect, with the glassmorphism applied only to the input field and not the entire component.
- **Resolution**: Refactored the search bar in `app/page.tsx` into a single, cohesive "glass pill" component.
  - The glassmorphism styles (`bg-white/10`, `backdrop-blur-md`, `border-white/20`) were moved from the `<Input>` to the parent `<form>` element.
  - The `<form>` now uses Flexbox to align the input and button.
  - The `<Input>` background was made transparent (`bg-transparent`) to blend into the new form container, and its independent borders and shadows were removed.
  - This creates a unified, modern, and fully translucent search bar, improving the overall aesthetic of the home page.

### Comprehensive Glassmorphism UI Overhaul (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The application's UI did not have a consistent "glassmorphism" theme. While some components were translucent, the effect was not applied globally.
- **Resolution**: A full-scale UI overhaul was performed to implement a cohesive, app-wide translucent theme.
  - **Global Animated Background**: A dynamic, animated gradient was added to `app/globals.css`. It sits in the background of the entire application, making the glassmorphism effect visible and adding a premium, modern feel.
  - **Analysis Page (`app/analysis/page.tsx`)**:
    - The `Tabs` component was restyled with a transparent background and a clean bottom-border indicator for the active tab, enhancing the floating glass effect.
    - All `Card` components (`PerspectiveCard`, `InfoListCard`) were updated to explicitly use glassmorphism styles (`bg-card/80`, `backdrop-blur-lg`, `border-border`), ensuring they appear as translucent panels floating above the animated background.
  - **Footer (`components/footer.tsx`)**: The footer was updated with a translucent background, a backdrop blur, and a subtle top border to match the header and maintain UI consistency.
- This comprehensive update unifies the entire application under a sophisticated and modern glassmorphism design system.

### Background Effect Refinement (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The global animated gradient was too intense, and its movement was distracting. The top-left gradient, in particular, was overlapping with the "Prism" logo in the header.
- **Resolution**: The background effect in `app/globals.css` was refined to be more subtle and less intrusive.
  - **Reduced Opacity**: The opacity of the `radial-gradient` colors was significantly lowered to 15%, making the glow effect much softer.
  - **Repositioning**: The gradients were pushed further into the corners to avoid overlap with UI elements.
  - **Slower & Smoother Animation**: The animation duration was increased from 30s to 40s, and the `translate` and `scale` values within the keyframes were reduced, resulting in a slower, less jarring movement.
  - This change makes the background a subtle, premium enhancement rather than a distraction.

### Discover Page Content Overhaul (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The `Discover` page used generic placeholder images and content that did not align with the application's focus on technology and AI-driven analysis.
- **Resolution**: The content in `app/discover/page.tsx` was completely overhauled to be more thematically relevant.
  - **Updated Topics**: The placeholder report titles and descriptions were replaced with topics centered on technology, AI, and science (e.g., "The Future of Artificial Intelligence," "Quantum Computing," "Decentralized Finance").
  - **Curated Images**: The generic Unsplash images were replaced with a curated set of high-quality, abstract images related to technology, data, and science, creating a more professional and visually cohesive experience.

### Discover Page UI Simplification (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The `Discover` page included a search/filter bar that was redundant, as the primary search functionality exists on the home page.
- **Resolution**: The UI of the `Discover` page was simplified by removing the search functionality.
  - The search input field was removed from `app/discover/page.tsx`.
  - The corresponding state management (`useState`) and filtering logic for the search feature were also removed, cleaning up the component.
  - The page now only retains the "Sort by" dropdown, providing a cleaner, more focused user experience for browsing featured topics.

### Broken Image Fix (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The image for the "Decentralized Finance" card on the `Discover` page was broken and not loading.
- **Resolution**: The broken URL in the `analysisReports` array within `app/discover/page.tsx` was replaced with a new, valid Unsplash URL pointing to a thematically appropriate abstract image representing blockchain technology.

### Remote Image Loading Fix (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: Images on the `Discover` page were still not loading even after fixing a broken URL.
- **Resolution**: The root cause was identified in the Next.js configuration. The `next.config.mjs` file was disabling image optimization (`unoptimized: true`) and lacked the necessary security policy to allow remote images.
  - The configuration was updated to include a `remotePatterns` entry, explicitly allowing images to be served from `images.unsplash.com`.
  - **This change requires a server restart to take effect.**
  - This fix ensures that all external images from Unsplash will now load correctly and securely across the application.

### Image Replacement (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The user requested a different image for the "Decentralized Finance" card on the `Discover` page.
- **Resolution**: The image URL for the specified card in `app/discover/page.tsx` was replaced with a new, thematically appropriate image from Unsplash.

### Image 404 Error Fix (2024-12-19)

- **Issue**: The replacement image for the "Decentralized Finance" card was also broken, returning a 404 error.
- **Resolution**: The faulty URL in `app/discover/page.tsx` was replaced again with a new, verified, and valid Unsplash URL to finally resolve the image loading issue.

#### UI Smoothness & Performance Polish

- **Issue**: General UI felt less fluid; animations could be smoother.
- **Resolution**:
  - **Framer Motion Damping/Stiffness**: Adjusted `stiffness` to `70` and `damping` to `18` in `itemVariants` (in `app/analysis/page.tsx`) for a more natural and fluid spring animation effect.
  - **Tabs Content Transition**: Added `ease: "easeInOut"` to the `transition` prop of the `motion.div` wrapping `TabsContent` in `app/analysis/page.tsx` for smoother tab switching animations.
  - **Component Memoization**: Wrapped `PerspectiveCard` and `InfoListCard` components (in `app/analysis/page.tsx`) with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, thereby improving overall rendering performance and UI fluidity.

**Next Update Required**: After any code modifications, architectural changes, or new feature implementations.

### Translucent UI Theme Overhaul (2024-12-19)

#### New Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: Very dark desaturated purple/blue (#1A1B26) with 50% opacity for a translucent effect.
- **Primary Text**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with 80% opacity for readability.
- **Secondary Text**: Light gray (#E0E0E0) with 60% opacity for subtle hints.
- **Input Field Background**: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with 90% opacity for a clean, modern look.
- **Accent/Primary Interactive**: Vibrant purple (#7B61FF) with 70% opacity for a subtle, elegant highlight.

#### Glassmorphism Effects
- **Header**: Transparent header with a subtle white underline for active links.
- **Search Bar**: Pill-shaped search bar with a white background, light gray border, and translucent purple accent.
- **Footer**: Transparent footer that blends seamlessly with the background.
- **Analysis Page Cards**: Sophisticated glassmorphism effect for the main content area, with a subtle blur and a soft, non-distracting gradient.

**Next Update Required**: After any code modifications, architectural changes, or new feature implementations.

### Reddit OAuth2 Integration (2025-07-24)
- Implemented `lib/reddit-auth.ts` for server-side OAuth2 authentication and API requests to Reddit.
- Uses client credentials grant for app-level access (no user context).
- All Reddit API calls should use `getRedditAccessToken()` and `fetchRedditData()` from this utility.
- Credentials are stored in `.env.local` and never hardcoded.
- Architectural decision: This approach is more robust, secure, and future-proof than public JSON endpoints, and allows for higher rate limits and more advanced Reddit API features.

### TabsBar Component Integration (2025-01-27)
- **Created**: New custom `components/ui/tabs-bar.tsx` component to replace `components/content/dynamic-tabs.tsx`.
- **Motivation**: User reported visual bugs with tab underline and active state styling. Required a complete visual overhaul to match provided screenshot with mobile-first, accessible design.
- **Key Features**:
  - Mobile-first responsive design with horizontal scrolling
  - Smooth animated underline using framer-motion that follows the active tab
  - Touch-friendly interactions (44px minimum height)
  - Full keyboard navigation (arrow keys, tab, enter/space)
  - Semantic ARIA attributes and roles for accessibility
  - Badge support with dynamic counts
  - Icon and text scaling for mobile breakpoints
  - No hardcoded content - fully prop-driven with strict TypeScript types

- **Integration**: Updated `app/analysis/page.tsx` to use the new TabsBar component:
  - Added `convertToTabItems()` helper function to transform `DynamicTabConfig` to `TabItem` format
  - Replaced `DynamicTabs` component with `TabsBar` and separate content rendering
  - Added memoized tab items calculation for performance
  - Maintained all existing functionality while improving visual design

- **Impact**: Resolves all tab styling issues, provides pixel-perfect design matching the screenshot, and ensures full mobile and accessibility compliance. The component is reusable across the application with consistent behavior.

### Mobile Navigation Fix (2025-01-27)
- **Issue**: The header component had no mobile navigation menu - only desktop navigation was implemented, making the app unusable on mobile devices.
- **Solution**: Complete rebuild of `components/header.tsx` with mobile-first responsive design:
  - **Desktop**: Logo on left, navigation links on right with smooth animated underlines using framer-motion
  - **Mobile**: Logo on left, hamburger menu button on right with slide-out navigation panel
  - **Animations**: Smooth slide-in/out transitions, icon rotation, staggered menu item animations
  - **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management, escape key support
