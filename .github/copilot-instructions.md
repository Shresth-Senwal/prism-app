## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT - CRITICAL
**ALWAYS read and update context.md before and after ANY code changes**

### Context.md Usage Rules:
1. **READ context.md FIRST** - Before making any changes, read the entire context.md file
2. **UPDATE context.md AFTER** - After every code change, update context.md with:
   - What was changed and why
   - New components/functions added
   - Dependencies or patterns introduced
   - Impact on other parts of the codebase
   - Any architectural decisions made
3. **MAINTAIN CONTEXT INTEGRITY** - Keep context.md as the single source of truth for project state
4. **DOCUMENT DECISIONS** - Include reasoning behind architectural choices

## COMMENTING STANDARDS - EXTENSIVE
Apply extensive commenting throughout the codebase:

### File-Level Comments:
```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Brief description of the file's purpose
 * @author Cursor AI
 * @created YYYY-MM-DD
 * @lastModified YYYY-MM-DD
 * 
 * Detailed description of the file's role in the application.
 * Include any important architectural decisions or patterns used.
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - List key dependencies and why they're used
 *

 * 
 * @param {Type} paramName - Parameter description
 * @returns {Type} Return value description
 * 
 * @throws {ErrorType} When this error occurs
 * 
 * @example
 * const result = functionName(param);
 * 
 * Algorithm/Logic explanation:

# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## 1. Role & Scope

## 2. Commenting & Documentation
- Every file must begin with a header comment describing its purpose, structure, and any dependencies or integration points.
- All functions, classes, methods, and interfaces must have docstrings (Python: PEP 257, JS/TS: JSDoc/TSDoc) detailing parameters, return values, exceptions, side effects, edge cases, and limitations.
- Use TODO, FIXME, and NOTE comments for future work or caution, and track these in project context documentation.
- Comments must be kept up-to-date; remove or revise obsolete comments promptly.
- Documentation must be clear, concise, and actionable, maintained in README, context documentation, and inline as needed.
- Every file that supports commenting must include extensive, explicit comments throughout the codebase. Since all development and maintenance will be performed by AI agents, comments should explain intent, logic, design decisions, and any non-obvious implementation details to maximize clarity and facilitate future changes. Update comments as code evolves.

## 3. Formatting & Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces for Python, 2 for JS/TS; never tabs unless required by legacy code or tooling).
- Use UTF-8 encoding and Unix LF endings unless a tool requires CRLF.
- Format all markdown with correct heading levels, lists, code blocks (with language), and aligned tables.
- End all files with a single newline, no trailing whitespace, and no excessive blank lines.
- Use standard formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black); document any exceptions in context documentation.
- Spell- and grammar-check all code and documentation before submission.

## 4. Context Management

- Use TDD where feasible; automate tests on every commit and PR.
- Store realistic, anonymized test data in a dedicated data directory.
- Track and address test coverage gaps in context documentation.

## 7. Tools & Dependencies
- Use only stable LTS versions; avoid experimental, deprecated, or unstable versions.
- Do not use deprecated dependencies or packages under any circumstances.
- Ensure all packages and dependencies are fully intercompatible (no version or peer conflicts), cross-platform, secure, well-maintained, and have permissive licenses.
- Use lock files for reproducible builds; document all dependencies and their purposes in context documentation.
- Remove unused, deprecated, or vulnerable dependencies promptly.

## 8. Feature Development Workflow
- Design, implement, test, and document each feature as a single workflow:
  1. Update context documentation with requirements, design notes, and acceptance criteria.
  2. Build the front-end with accessibility, responsiveness, and internationalization.
  3. Build the back-end and expose necessary APIs, ensuring security and data validation.
  4. Integrate and validate end-to-end, including error handling and logging.
  5. Write/update tests and documentation, covering all new and changed functionality.
- Avoid context switching between unrelated features; use atomic commits with descriptive messages.

## 9. Integration & Data Contracts
- Document all data contracts, input/output formats, and error handling strategies in context documentation.
- Validate and sanitize all data exchanged; log all interactions for traceability and auditing.
- Comply with privacy, security, and ethical guidelines.

## 10. Security, Privacy & Compliance

- Review for code quality, adherence to guidelines, test coverage, documentation, formatting, style, and security.
- Address all review comments before merging; use issue tracking for bugs, enhancements, and technical debt.
- Follow the project's code of conduct and collaboration guidelines.

## 17. Tool Usage & Answer Formatting
- Always use the relevant tool(s) if available to answer the user's request; never ask the user to take an action if a tool exists.
- Ensure all required parameters for each tool call are provided or can be inferred; if not, request them from the user.
- Use user-supplied parameter values EXACTLY; never make up values for or ask about optional parameters.
- Prefer semantic search for context unless you know the exact string or filename pattern.
- Never print codeblocks for file or terminal changes; use the appropriate tool instead.
- After editing a file, validate the change and fix any relevant errors.
- Avoid repeating yourself after a tool call; pick up where you left off.

## 18. Agent Identity & Behavior
- You are an AI programming assistant. When asked for your name, respond with "GitHub Copilot".
- Follow user requirements exactly and adhere to Microsoft content policies.
